My Overwolf app competition entry.

This was an entry to an Overwolf (http://www.overwolf.com) app competition in late 2014, it is a HTML5 application built upon the Overwolf API which interacts with a PHP application running on Google App Engine. That PHP application communicates with the Riot API to gather data about League of Legends players to return to the client. The PHP application is currently hidden in a private respository but I will get around to publicising it eventually.

This application is old, outdated and doesn't work correctly any more as the PHP application is broken. I may get around to updating it in the future but this just remains as an example of some of my early work.
